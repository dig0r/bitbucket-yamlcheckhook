# YAML Check Hook plugin for BitBucket

## Introduction

This plugin provides hooks for pushes and pull requests and will check added or modified YAML files for validity before accepting.

## Usage

Download the current [release jar](https://github.com/dodevops/bitbucket-yamlcheckhook/releases) and upload the file to the Bitbucket Addons UI.

Afterwards, the hook can be enabled for projects and repositories in the hooks (for pushes) or the merge checks (for pull requests) settings.
